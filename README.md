# Multimethods
A multimethods implementation for C++03 (Visitor) and C++14 (Visitor and RTTI).

This library is result of manyyears work for fun. I have great interest to multimethods theme which attracted me from C++03 age. Because C++17 and even C++20 don't provide native multimethods implementation I decide to share these.
Ideas of these implementations relatively simple but their descriptions take many space. Thus I keep this readme without of it. But I can give URLs to russian forum topics where these design ideas detaily described. Also this lib contain many comments on russian, sorry.
